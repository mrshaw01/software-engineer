# Software Engineer Python

A curated collection of Python projects, code snippets, and system design exercises that demonstrate advanced software engineering skills using Python.

## Directory Structure

```

.
├── python-basic/ # Essential Python data types and syntax
├── python-advanced/ # Deeper Python topics and standard libraries
└── README.md # Project overview (this file)

```

## How to Use

Each numbered module includes a `README.md` that explains the concept and code files that demonstrate practical use cases. You can:

```bash
cd python-advanced/08-decorators
python basic_function_decorator.py
```

All scripts are Python 3.7+ compatible. Some may require third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy in `07-random-number`).

## Learning Philosophy

This project emphasizes:

- Clear separation between concept and example
- Small, focused Python files instead of large notebooks
- Organized structure for long-term retention and reuse
- Code that you can run and tinker with
