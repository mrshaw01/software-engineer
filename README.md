A curated, high-quality collection of learning resources focused on **Python** and soon **C/C++**, designed to build strong software engineering foundations and system-level understanding.

## How to Use

Each numbered folder contains a `README.md` explaining the concepts, along with runnable `.py` files. For example:

```bash
cd python-advanced/08-decorators
python basic_function_decorator.py
```

Some scripts require third-party libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `scipy`, `torch`).

All code is compatible with **Python 3.7+** and written to be **minimal, focused, and testable**.

## Highlights

### Python

- **OOP Mastery**: Classes, inheritance, metaclasses, descriptors (`python-OOP/`)
- **Advanced Topics**: Decorators, context managers, function caching, concurrency
- **Data Structures**: Lists, tuples, dicts, sets with practical usage

### C++

- **C++ Basics**: Syntax, functions, pointers, structs, scope, enums (`cpp-basic/`)
- **Modern C++**: RAII, smart pointers, move semantics, alignment, RVO (`cpp-advanced/`)
- **C++ OOP**: Classes, access specifiers, inheritance, polymorphism, templates

### Systems & Performance

- **CUDA Programming**: Host/device model, kernel launch, memory management (`CUDA/`)
- **MPI Programming**: Practical distributed programs, matrix ops, and validation runs (`MPI/`)
- **Docs**: Python-C++ interfacing, GIL handling, CUDA tuning, mixed precision training (`docs/`)

## Learning Philosophy

- Small, modular examples — no cluttered notebooks
- Clear separation between concept, code, and commentary
- Emphasis on design, performance, and maintainability
- Builds knowledge progressively — ideal for serious learners and professionals

## Upcoming Work

Future modules will include:

- 📌 **System-level C/C++ for Python Developers**
- 📌 **Compiler Optimizations and ABI Analysis**
- 📌 **Distributed Memory with MPI & OpenMP**
- 📌 **Advanced Descriptor Patterns in Python**
- 📌 **Case Studies in Python ↔ C++ Interoperability**

Stay tuned!
