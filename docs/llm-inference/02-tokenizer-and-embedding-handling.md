# Tokenizer & Embedding Handling

Efficient inference in large language models (LLMs) begins with input processing—specifically, tokenization and embedding. This section outlines how tokenizers work, how embeddings are computed, and how these components are optimized for serving systems.

## Tokenization

Tokenization maps input text into a sequence of integer IDs that the model can understand. The process is model-specific and non-trivial due to subword representations.

### Common Tokenization Algorithms

- **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**
  Merges frequent character pairs to form subword tokens. Used in GPT-2, GPT-3.

- **SentencePiece (Unigram/BPE)**
  Language-independent, treats input as raw bytes. Used in T5, LLaMA, Alpaca.

- **WordPiece**
  Similar to BPE but focuses on maximizing likelihood. Used in BERT.

### Tokenization Pipeline

1. **Preprocessing**
   Normalize input (e.g., Unicode NFKC, lowercasing).
2. **Subword Tokenization**
   Apply model-specific vocabulary rules.
3. **Special Tokens**
   Add BOS (beginning-of-sequence), EOS (end-of-sequence), padding if required.
4. **Integer Mapping**
   Map tokens to integer IDs based on the tokenizer's vocabulary.

### Inference Considerations

- **Latency Impact**
  Tokenization latency can dominate short-sequence inference; consider caching or parallelization.

- **Tokenizer-Model Compatibility**
  Mismatched tokenizers (e.g., mismatched vocab or token splitting) can degrade model performance.

- **Batch Tokenization**
  Use batched and fast tokenizers (e.g., Hugging Face FastTokenizer) to minimize preprocessing time.

## Embedding Lookup

Once token IDs are generated, the model maps them to dense vectors using an **embedding matrix**.

### Embedding Layer

- Shape: `[vocab_size, hidden_dim]`
- For input token ID `i`, output is `embedding[i]`

### Optimizations

- **Quantized Embeddings**
  Use int8 or bfloat16 representations to reduce memory usage.

- **Sharded Embedding Tables**
  Useful in multi-GPU or distributed inference setups to reduce memory footprint per device.

- **Cache Static Embeddings**
  For models with frozen vocabularies, embeddings can be cached across requests.

## Embedding Handling for Generation

During autoregressive decoding, new tokens are appended one at a time. Efficient embedding reuse is crucial:

- **Prefill Phase**
  Lookup embeddings for the full prompt sequence.

- **Decode Phase**
  Lookup only for the last token ID, enabling step-wise generation.

### Implementation Tips

- Avoid full re-embedding of the entire sequence in each step.
- Separate compute paths for prefill and decode phases (see: prefill/decode separation).

## Practical Notes

- **Tokenizer Throughput** can be a bottleneck; use Rust-accelerated tokenizers or C++ bindings where possible.
- **Custom Tokenizer Integration** must match vocabulary and special token conventions exactly.
- **Streaming Support**: Tokenizers must support incremental decoding (e.g., partial byte streams) in streaming inference.

## Summary

Tokenizer and embedding handling are the front-end backbone of LLM inference. Correct and efficient implementation is critical for minimizing input latency and ensuring semantic correctness. Optimizations at this stage—such as batched tokenization and quantized embeddings—can significantly improve system throughput in production deployments.
