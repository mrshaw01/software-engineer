# Distributed Training and Parallelism

This folder provides a **comprehensive guide to distributed deep learning training techniques**. It covers fundamental concepts, advanced parallelism strategies, and hands-on examples for frameworks like **PyTorch**, **DeepSpeed**, and **Megatron-LM**.

The goal is to help **software engineers and machine learning practitioners** understand, design, and implement **scalable training solutions** for large language models (LLMs) and other deep learning systems.
